Cryptology is the study of writing in codes, so that only the intended recipient of the message is able to read it. Interestingly, it has been put forward that one of the very first forms of an encrypted message was a basic written text, because most people at that time could not read, and therefore its contents were unknown. Cryptography, from the Greek for hidden and writing, is the creation of codes, while encryption is the actual changing of standard text to coded tex. Cryptanalysis is, then, the analytical reading of a coded message to understand its message, often by a third, or unintended, party. All these words are centred around the same basic meaning, a coded message, but with a subtle difference as regards the stage of the equation.
